# Code of Conduct for the Maakaf.com Project

## 1. Purpose

The Maakaf.com project is committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for everyone. We believe that a diverse and inclusive environment fosters creativity, collaboration, and the best free software. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behavior within our project spaces, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## 2. Expected Behavior

We expect all participants in the Maakaf.com project to adhere to the following principles:

* **Be Welcoming and Inclusive:** Strive to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable and valued.

* **Be Respectful:** Treat all community members with respect and courtesy. Disagreements happen, but personal attacks, insults, or demeaning language are never acceptable.

* **Be Considerate:** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.

* **Be Patient:** Remember that people have different levels of experience, communication styles, and may be communicating in a language that is not their primary one.

* **Be Collaborative:** Work together constructively. Seek to understand different perspectives and resolve disagreements in a positive manner.

* **Be Careful in Your Words:** Choose your words carefully and avoid language that could be offensive, exclusionary, or interpreted as harassment.

* **Give and Gracefully Accept Constructive Feedback:** We all make mistakes. Help others improve by offering constructive criticism, and be open to receiving it yourself.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* **Violent threats or language** directed against another person.

* **Discriminatory jokes and language** based on any protected characteristic.

* **Posting sexually explicit or violent material.**

* **Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").**

* **Personal insults,** especially those using racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or other discriminatory terms.

* **Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.**

* **Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.**

* **Repeated harassment of others.**

* **Sustained disruption of discussions or other project activities.**

## 4. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it as soon as possible. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
